Sage
=============================================================

`Sage <http://sagemath.org>`_ is an open source collection of mathematical
software with a common Python interface.  The lead developer is William
Stein, a number theorist in the Mathematics Department at the University of
Washington.  

The Sage notebook was an original model for the :ref:`ipython_notebook`. 

You can try Sage online by typing into a cell at
`<https://sagecell.sagemath.org/>`_.  You can type straight 
Python as well as using the enhanced capabilities of Sage.
