Overview and syllabus
=====================

This course will cover a large number of topics in a somewhat superficial
manner.  The main goals are to:

* Introduce a number of concepts related to machine architecture,
  programming languages, etc. that necessary to understand if one plans to
  write computer programs beyond simple exercises, where it is important
  that they run efficiently.

* Introduce a variety of software tools that are useful to programmers
  working in scientific computing.

* Gain a bit of hands on experience with these tools so that at the end
  of the quarter students will be able to continue working with them and
  be in a good position to learn more on their own from available
  resources.
