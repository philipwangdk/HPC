The buggy code problem1.py and problem2.py are to be debugged.

It is suggested that you use the IPython shell and the pdb debugger as
demonstrated in the video posted from the lab.

Corrected versions can be found in problem1b.py and problem2b.py.

Try:
    $ diff problem1.py problem1b.py

to see the differences, for example.
