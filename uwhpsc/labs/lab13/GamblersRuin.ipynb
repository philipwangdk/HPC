      "# Gambler's Ruin examples\n",
      "\n",
      "The Gambler's Ruin problem is a special case of a \"random walk\".  In this notebook we use random numbers to do Monte Carlo simulations and compare the results with some mathematical expressions.   The basic idea is that a gambler has a finite amount of money and continues betting until the money runs out.  In the version used here there are two gamblers and the game ends when one gambler is ruined (and the other has won all the money).\n",
      "\n",
      "Suppose two gamblers have $n_1$ and $n_2$ pennies to start.  Each round of betting is won by player 1 with probability $p$ or by player 2 with probability $q=1-p$.  The loser transfers a penny to the winner.  The game ends when one player has no pennies left.  \n",
