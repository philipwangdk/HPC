2014 Homework assignments
-------------------------

There will be 4 homeworks during the quarter with
tentative due dates listed below:

 * :ref:`homework1`: Thursday of Week 2, April 10  
 * :ref:`homework2`: Thursday of Week 4, April 24
 * :ref:`homework3`: Thursday of Week 6, May 8 -- :ref:`homework3_solution`
 * :ref:`homework4`: Tuesday of Week 9, May 27 -- :ref:`homework4_solution`
 * :ref:`project`: Wednesday of Week 11, June 11 -- :ref:`project_hints`

There will be a "final project" tentatively due on Wednesday, June 11.  
This will count twice as much as a homework and will be similar in
spirit but longer and tying together several things from the quarter
into a more interesting computing assignment.
