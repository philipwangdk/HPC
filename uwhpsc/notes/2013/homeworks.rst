2013 Homework 
====================

.. warning :: These are the 2013 homework assignment.  
   See :ref:`2014_homeworks` for this year's assignments.


There will be 6 homeworks during the quarter with
tentative due dates listed below:

 * :ref:`2013_homework1`: Wednesday of Week 2, April 10
 * :ref:`2013_homework2`: Wednesday of Week 3, April 17
 * :ref:`2013_homework3`: Wednesday of Week 5, May 1 
 * :ref:`2013_homework4`: Wednesday of Week 6, May 8

 * :ref:`2013_homework6`: Friday of Week 9, May 29
 * :ref:`2013_project`: Wednesday of Week 11, June 12

.. comment:
    There will be a "final project" due on Wednesday, June 12.  
    This will count twice as much as a homework and will be similar in
    spirit but longer and tying together several things from the quarter
    into a more interesting computing assignment.
