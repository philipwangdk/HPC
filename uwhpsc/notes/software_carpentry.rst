Software Carpentry
=============================================================

`Sofware Carpentry <http://software-carpentry.org>`_
started out as a course at the University of Toronto
taught by Greg Wilson.  He has since left the university and turned this
into a major effort to help researchers be more productive by teaching them
basic computing skills. 

Their "boot camps" are taught at many universities and other insitutions
around the world, check the `calendar
<http://software-carpentry.org/bootcamps/index.html#calendar>`_ to see if
one is coming up near you.

Some sections particularly relevant to this course, with links to videos:

* `The Shell <http://software-carpentry.org/4_0/shell/>`_
